                <h2>A Young and Aspiring Student</h2>
                <p>Satoru Iwata was born on December 6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata showed leadership skills as class president, student council president, and club president. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that utilized telephone lines. In 1964, with money saved up from a dish-washing job and some allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator. After attending Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in 1975, he started developing his own games during his junior year. Iwata used an electronic calculator that he shared with his friends to play the several simple number games he produced, such as Missile Attack and Volleyball.</p>

                <p>In 1978, Iwata obtained his first computer, a Commodore PET. He dismantled and studied the machine to try and understand it. The computer coincidentally had a central processing unit (MOS 6502) similar to the one used by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), a gaming console for which he would later develop games. Following high school, Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology later that year, where he majored in computer science.</p>

                <p>In addition to attending the school, Iwata was one of several unpaid interns at Commodore Japan, helping the subsidiary's head engineer—Yash Terakura—with technical and software-development tasks. Terakura would later serve as a mentor to Iwata, teaching him about hardware engineering to supplement Iwata's extensive software knowledge. Iwata and several of his friends rented an apartment in Akihabara and soon formed a club where they would create and code games. Classmates living in nearby apartments referred to Iwata's room as "Game Center Iwata". Iwata would often show off his games to the Seibu department store's computer department, which led to a group of employees there inviting him to join their company, HAL Laboratory, Inc in 1980.</p>
